# 📷 Offline Image Uploader — React Native & Node.js

This project showcases an **offline-first React Native app** that enables users to capture or select images, add captions, and view them offline. When online, the app syncs images and metadata with a minimal Node.js server, making them available across devices.


## 🚀 Features
- Take or pick a photo from the gallery  
- Save with a short caption  
- Fully offline support (capture, save, view without internet)  
- Sync images and metadata when online  
- Conflict resolution (latest `modifiedAt` wins)  
- Minimal Express server for uploads & listing images  
- FlatList optimization for smooth rendering

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/offline-image-uploader.git
cd offline-image-uploader
```

## Server Setup
```bash
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express multer cors
node index.js

Server runs at: http://localhost:3000
```

## APIs:
- POST /upload → Uploads image + metadata
- GET /list → Returns all uploaded items

## Client Setup:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run start

npm run android
or
npm run ios
```

## 📱 React Native Client (Key Decisions):
- AsyncStorage → Store images & metadata locally while offline
- UUID → Generate unique IDs for offline entries
- NetInfo → Detect network status & trigger sync
- FlatList → Optimized for performance
- Conflict Handling → If the same image exists both locally & remotely, the version with the latest modifiedAt timestamp is kept

## 🌐 Minimal Server
- Built with Express.js
- Stores images in the/uploads folder
- Handles multipart/form-data via Multer

## 🔮 Possible Enhancements:
- User authentication
- Image compression before upload
- Background sync with retry logic
- Cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Firebase Storage)
